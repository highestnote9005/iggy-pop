        <p>Upon being awarded the Pulitzer at columbia University, in New York,<br>
            journalist Cleiton Harris receives an unusual invitation from the Seattle
            Post <br> to investigate the disappearance of an American in Brazil. As his 
            investigations progress, <br> he comes across an international network
            specializing in kidnapping<br> and organ trafficking. But when he meets his
            Brazilian friend Edwardo, <br> an engineer, ex-combatant of the Foreign
            Legion, a chain of events leads him to discover <br> that he was not chosen by
            chance. A diabolical plan is under way <br> and his friend is part of the puzzle.
            Persecutions, secrets from the past, brutal <br> murders and an  atmosphere of
            tension will make Cleiton understand <br> that in the criminal underworld,
            justice is dark.
